# Local-library
Local library project

This application was created using primarily JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to prove my ability to make a real world application
that can take data then use that data to catalog items such as books.

This project is intended to show users which books are available and not available with using the given library information.

My future goals for this project would to be to add a api call for different sets of book data to make it fit the users needs better (their local library info).

Enjoy!
